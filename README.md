# OfflineRaidDefenders
[Rust Plugin] PVE

__**OfflineRaidDefenders**__
- the purpose is to make offline raids more challenging, while semi-protecting offline players when you dont want to just forbid offline raiding.
- Cuando un player raidea la base de otro player, aparecen unos npcs vestidos de policia para defenderla, solo si el jugador es offline. Opcional tambien online.
- Only triggered by explosive stuff (explosive ammo, satchels, c4, rockets, mlrs) fired by anyone not authorized in that base's TC.
- Cops will respawned after X time when killed.
- Cops use kits. Drop loot optional.
- Cops stats in config (aim cone, hp, ...).
- Cops scalable with attacker team size (hp, aim cone, ... maybe even scale in kits used, respawn time, number of cops...).
- maybe Razor could implement this as an optional trigger for NPCRandomRaids. Maybe triggering difficulties based on the number of player authorised in the defending base. Or maybe in the number of attackers. Or make it optional.
